- `<header>`: Represents the header section of the page.
- `<main>`: Contains the main content, structured with flexbox for layout.
- `<aside>`: Used for secondary content or a sidebar.
- `<article>`: Represents the main content area.
- `<section>`: Used for a distinct section of content, such as a related article or information block.
- `<footer>`: Represents the footer section of the page.
